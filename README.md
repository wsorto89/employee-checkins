Full stack app using ReactJS front-end, Node and Express for the back-end, and MySQL for the DB.

## Front End
I used create-react-app for the front end.
First, we have to download the node packages, so run:
### `cd frontend`
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

# Back End
I used an express-generator for the back end.
To download the packages, from the home directory run:
### `cd backend`
### `npm install` or `yarn install`

## Running the App
After the dependencies for the frontend and backend are resolved,
From the home directory simply run:
### `npm install` or `yarn install`
### `npm start-dev` or `yarn start-dev`
This should spin up the backend on localhost:3001 and open up a tab on localhost:3000 for the frontend
