# employee-checkins
Full stack app using ReactJS front-end, Node and Express for the back-end, and MySQL for the DB. I also used TypeScript for both as I find it to be very helpful.

On page load, you see a list of cards for each employee, clicking on an employee's card will check in for them. In the DB, the employee id and timestamp is saved.

## Front End
I used create-react-app for the front end.

# Back End
I used an express-generator for the back end.

## Running the App
First, lets resolve the dependencies for the home directory.
Secondly, there's a script to resolve the dependencies for both the front end and back end.
Lastly, we run both together.
Here the commands to run:
### `yarn install`
### `yarn install-all`
### `yarn start`
This should spin up the backend on localhost:3001 and open up a tab on localhost:3000 for the frontend.
